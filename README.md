Guardian Wave is dedicated to addressing the critical issue of women's safety
Problem Statement: 
•	Women in India face safety concerns in public, workplaces, and transport.
•	Lack of self-defense training and legal awareness leaves many vulnerable.
•	Existing safety apps focus only on SOS alerts, lacking proactive solutions.
•	Need for a comprehensive system integrating training, legal aid, and technology.

Addressal of the Issue:
Guardian Wave is dedicated to addressing the critical issue of women's safety in everyday life, as well as in more vulnerable situations such as workplace harassment and abuse. One of the primary factors contributing to these safety concerns is the lack of awareness and understanding of legal rights and protections. Many women face challenges in navigating the legal system due to legal illiteracy, which can leave them vulnerable and unsure of how to seek justice.
Our project is designed to bridge this gap by providing women with valuable insights into existing laws that safeguard their rights and well-being. By offering a user-friendly platform, GuardianWave enables women to understand their legal options and take informed action. Upon receiving details about a specific issue, our system will assist by outlining the relevant laws, potential courses of action, and effective strategies for approaching the legal scenario. Our goal is to empower women with knowledge and practical guidance, ensuring they can address legal challenges confidently and efficiently.



Some of the features of the project include:

The agent can also suggest defensive maneuvers, de-escalation techniques, and preventative measures tailored to different scenarios, ensuring users are equipped with practical strategies to enhance their personal safety and awareness.
